      <p>
        The underworld in Greek mythology was believed to exist deep below the earth's surface. It was the final destination for mortal souls after death, with a few exceptions like heroes.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The underworld contained various geographical features and realms. The main sections were the Asphodel Meadows, Elysian Fields, Tartarus, and the palace of Hades and Persephone. Souls of average mortals who did not commit major sins or heroic deeds dwelled forever in the dreary Asphodel Meadows.
      </p>

      <p> 
        The underworld was guarded by Cerberus, the monstrous three-headed hound. The rivers Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe all flowed through it. Charon ferried souls across the rivers to reach their final destinations.

      <p>
        Overall the Greek underworld was not a pleasant nor welcoming place. But it played an integral role in their mythology as the inevitable final home of mortal souls.
