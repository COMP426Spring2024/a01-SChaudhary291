      <p>
        Hades was one of the children of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. When the Olympian gods overthrew the Titans, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divided dominion over the realms. Zeus took the skies, Poseidon the seas, and Hades the underworld.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hades ruled the underworld with an iron fist. All mortal souls ended up in his realm, with the exceptions of heroes whom the gods allowed into Elysium. He was not typically portrayed as overtly evil, but still inspired fear and dread.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Hades very rarely left his realm, as he disliked associating with gods or mortals. His most famous appearances in myths involve abducting Persephone to be his wife and attempting to bind the hero Heracles. Even the other Olympians avoided him when possible.
